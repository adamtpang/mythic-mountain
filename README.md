# Mythic Mountain

## Background

"Mythic Mountain" is a medieval-style, pokemon-style-combat browser rpg. You play as a nameless hero who fights his way up a mountain to slay the tyrannical dragon who threatens to burn the town below if its citizens stop pledging fealty through sacrifices. As you make your way up the mountain, you recruit allies on the same mission.

## Functionality & MVPs

You'll be able to fight foes using the current player from your party in combat.

They'll be health bars for characters and enemies, and a party system, so the user can switch characters in and out of combat, just like Pok√©mon.

Players can fight enemies or switch out to any character in their party. Every character will have their own HPs and sets of moves, along with descriptions of what each move does.

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs

I'll be using HTML, CSS, JS, Webpack, npm, and Canvas' API to render the board.
